    "question": ["what is cutaneous larva migrans", "definition clm", "what is clm"],
    "learning": "Cutaneous Larva Migrans (CLM) is a skin disease caused by the migration of animal hookworm larvae within the epidermis. It presents as itchy, serpiginous (creeping) skin lesions.",

  },
  {
    "question": ["causative agent", "what causes clm", "agent of clm"],
    "learning": "CLM is caused by larvae of animal hookworms, commonly Ancylostoma braziliense and Ancylostoma caninum, which are parasites of dogs and cats.",

  {
    "question": ["mode of transmission", "how is clm transmitted", "transmission"],
    "learning": "Transmission occurs when infective filariform larvae present in contaminated sand or soil penetrate the human skin, usually through barefoot walking or sitting on beaches.",

  {
    "question": ["clinical features", "symptoms of clm", "signs of clm"],

  {
    "question": ["diagnosis", "how to diagnose clm", "diagnosis of clm"],
    "learning": "Diagnosis of CLM is mainly clinical, based on patient history and the characteristic creeping eruption. Skin biopsy may occasionally identify larvae. Differential diagnoses should be considered.",
